## Prerequsites
* Oracle Java 1.8.0_341
* Apache Maven 3.6.3
* Docker 19.03.11
* Docker Compose 2.5.0

> **NOTE:** If you are using a different Docker Compose version, customize the version number inside docker-compose.yml accordingly

## Demo Environment
* Case1: OCI instance with 8 cores, 64GB of memory, Oracle Linux7.9
* Case2: Ubuntu20.04.4 on Windows10, core i7, 4cores, 16GB of memory

## Step1: Create docker image with Java Enterprise Performance Pack
Use Oracle Linux7 based Dockerfile(Offered as Open Source at Oracle) to create Java Performance Pack image.

### 1. Clone the Docker Images from Oracle
```
git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images
```

```
cd docker-images/OracleJava/8
```

### 2. Download the binaries of Java Enterprise Performance Pack for Linux x64

Download the binaries available via MyOracleSupport.
[](https://jpg-data.us.oracle.com/artifactory/re-release-local/jdk/8u345-perf/6/bundles/linux-x64/jdk-8u345-perf-linux-x64.tar.gz)

Put the binary file under the directory of "docker-images/OracleJava/8".

### 3. Edit Dockerfile to correspond to Java Enterprise Performance Pack
```
cd docker-images/OracleJava/8
```
```
vi Dockerfile
```

Change the java binary package name and java version to correspond to Java Enterprise Performance Pack.

* Comment out the package name and add revised contents instead.
```
# ENV JAVA_PKG=server-jre-8u333-linux-x64.tar.gz \
```
```
ENV JAVA_PKG=jdk-8u345-perf-linux-x64.tar.gz \
```

* Also comment out the java version and add revised contents instead.
```
# ENV JAVA_VERSION=1.8.0_333 \
```
```
ENV JAVA_VERSION=1.8.0_345-perf \
```

* Comment out the checksum part to avoid conflict while creating the docker image.
```
# echo "$JAVA_SHA256 */tmp/jdk.tgz" | sha256sum -c -; \
```

### 4. Create Docker images based on Java Enterprise Performance Pack
```
cd docker-images/OracleJava/8
```

```
docker build --file Dockerfile --tag oracle/jdkperf:8 .
```

Confirm the docker image has been successfully created.

```
[opc@eppdemo 8]$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
oracle/jdkperf      8                   50c69cee9af6        4 seconds ago       316MB
<none>              <none>              f9b0fbbfa2b2        25 seconds ago      363MB

```

## Step2: Build sample project
### 1. Clone the repository
Move to a new directory to download the sample project.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/junsuzu/Enterprise-Performance-Pack.git
```

### 2. Run script to build the sample project and docker images
Navigate to https://container-registry.oracle.com/, select serverjre from Java repository, and sign in with Oracle account.

![Download Picture07](images/pic07.JPG)

```
cd Enterprise-Performance-Pack/demo
```
```
chmod +x ./*
```
```
./build.sh
```

During building process, enter user name and password of your Oracle account for access to oracle container registry.
```

After the script being executed successfully, docker images should have been created as below: 

```
[opc@eppdemo demo]$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                     TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE

```

## Step3: Run the demo
### 1. Start containers
```
cd Enterprise-Performance-Pack/demo
```
Execute docker-compose command to start all necessary docker containers.
```
docker-compose up
```
After the demo, execute docker-compose command to stop all running containers:
```
docker-compose down
```

### 2. Configure Grafana Dashboard
Navigate to: http://your-instance-ip:3000/login to access the Grafana dashboard (Make sure you have added Ingress rule on your OCI demo instance to make port of 3000 being opened), and login with admin/admin for username/passowrd.(You can click "skip" to skip changing password)

Click on the Dashboards icon on the left of the Grafana interface and choose EPPDemo on the right panel:

You will find throughput and latency comparison between Performance Pack and legacy JDK8 as below.

![Download Picture03](images/pic03.JPG)

If you change the parameter of "upperBound" from 9999 to 99999 in docker-compose.yml, to make the load testing much more intensively, you will find the performance differentiated significently between two JDK runtimes as below:

Execute docker-compose command to stop all running containers.
```
docker-compose down
```
